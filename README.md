# Dungeons & Dragons Automatic Currency Splitter

This was a project build to ensure that my party can easily split any odd amounts of cash we
acquired up without needing to divvy up ye olde calculators.

Credit for the calculations side of things goes over to our very beloved cleric, Kilwin.

## Did this really need to get created using React of all things?

Definitely not, but as I'm in the midst of learning React, I thought I'd break the ancient tenet
of software development and willingly over-engineer the heck out of it.

This code still needs A bunch of cleanup, but just knowing that it works and exists on:

[dnd-cash-split.firebase.app](dnd-cash-split.firebase.app)

Is pretty satisfying to me tbh!
